#**Progressive Web Apps, introduced by Google, eagerly approved by Microsoft and reluctantly adopted by Apple, are gaining massive popularity among global leaders of online technologies. Companies such as Pinterest, Aliexpress, Trivago, OLX and Forbes, which have already field-tested the abilities of PWA technology to boost user engagement, proved that it is the best answer to the challenges of the mobile world.**

#What are Progressive Web Apps?

**A Progressive Web App is a type of web application which can be used as a web page and mobile app on any given device. PWAs are created by fulfilling the majority of requirements listed in Google's checklist, after which a Progressive Web Application is fast, reliable and engaging.**

The general idea of Progressive Web Apps is quite easy to display. They are apps written in web technologies (JavaScript, CSS, HTML) that look and behave just like regular web pages. They are visible in Search Engine Page Results and linkable, but offer similar functionalities to native mobile apps: they work offline, can send push notifications and use device hardware the same way as native apps. 

PWAs seem to be a modern fusion between the mobile and desktop worlds but - since the term doesn't suggest any particular implementation - it may be challenging to craft a dictionary definition of them. And Google, the godfather of PWA technology, doesn't help.

[Google's](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) official introduction says:

Progressive Web Apps are **user experiences** that have the reach of the web, and are:

- [Reliable](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/#reliable) - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
- [Fast](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/#fast) - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
- [Engaging](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/#engaging) - Feel like a natural app on the device, with immersive user experience.

This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen. 


#How to understand the term PWA
According to Google, the PWA standard is an approach focused on the user experience, but the rest of its definition intensifies confusion. When is a website fast and engaging enough to call it a PWA? Is it crucial to install it on the user's home screen? Or maybe it is all about the immersive full-screen experience? In short: what exactly makes a web app, a Progressive Web App?

Google, probably deliberately, doesn't provide a clear definition of Progressive Web Apps. The idea of an open web seems to conflict with a strong standard defined by a central player on the market. And the giant can't allow for the suspicion that PWAs - introduced by the team from Mountain View - force web owners to use Google’s own standards, technologies or implementation methods. Pointing out a general direction or - better put - a general philosophy to building online touchpoints is a safer choice than forcing a specific method of making them.

Therefore, Google introduced the PWA standard and delivered Lighthouse – an open-source tool that enables developers to audit a web app for PWA features.

Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of your Progressive Web Apps, eliminates much of the manual testing that was previously required.
