In the beginning, it took the form of a delicate suggestion, but with the introduction of the mobile-first index, being mobile-friendly has become an obligation for website owners. That was the moment when PWA technology quickly started to gain fame as an easy-to-use answer to this problem. Indeed, it provides the best possible UX and has Google's support, but what about SEO-controversial JavaScript, the core of PWA?</strong></p> <hr> <p><strong><a href="https://divante.com/pwabook#form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign up for updates on The PWA Book<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></strong> ⭐️</p> <hr> <p><strong>Table of content</strong></p> <ul><li>PWAs in the world of SEO</li> <li>PWA SEO Best Practices

PWA is a standard started and promoted by Google, and while there is no evidence that it is a ranking factor, it definitely shouldn't be neglected. Why? Users' attention is at stake. Google can't allow them to favour native apps over traditional websites even though promoting PWAs may, at some point, cannibalize Google Play. Since most of Google's revenues come from ads in Google Search, not Google Play, Google needs to hold on to the advantage in Search by all means. It is the foundation of its market position.</p> <h2 id="pwas-in-the-world-of-seo"><a href="#pwas-in-the-world-of-seo" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> PWAs in the world of SEO</h2> <p>The investment in creating a PWA designed to deliver a better mobile web search experience seems to be a natural choice in the mobile era. Progressive Web Apps provide an astonishing and multiplatform user experience but are also crawler-friendly and indexable, which—in theory—should be the perfect mix. Yet, JavaScript, which is the foundation of every PWA, may still cause some controversy in the SEO world.</p> <p>For years Googlebot couldn't crawl JavaScript code. It was first announced that it is generally able to render and understand JS-powered websites in 2015, but even three years later, there were still obstacles to effectively crawling apps based on pure JS.</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kimdewe/status/1018865678504419329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Mueller, senior Webmaster Trends Analyst from Google<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, claimed there are some JS-powered sites on which Googlebot will be able to handle client-side JS.

The size of JS scripts, code quality, and complexity can significantly affect battery life, especially on low-end devices. Longer JS execution times forced on the user's device delay the first paint of the &quot;hero&quot; content that the user sees on the screen. All of these negatively influence metrics such as Time to First Paint, and First Contentful Paint, which measure how fast content is served to users. The Page Speed is a direct ranking factor, but also has an indirect influence on the SEPRs, by increasing the bounce rate and reducing dwell time.</p> <p>If there are so many red flags, maybe it would be a better solution to resign from JS? Unfortunately, it is not that straightforward. Thanks to JavaScript, websites are &quot;alive&quot; and deliver a better user experience than static ones, built with plain HTML. And it is not only a bit of eye-candy, as the time users spend on sites is also a ranking factor for Google. And so the answer to the question of whether or not JavaScript is harmful to SEO is: it depends. It is hard to say upfront which elements will be successfully interpreted and indexed by Google and which will not.</p> <p>Google officially stated that <em>&quot;rendering of JavaScript-powered websites in Google Search is deferred until Googlebot has the resources available to process that content.&quot;</em></p> <p>It is, however, hardly an unambiguous tip, and quite a challenge for businesses. The chances of being clicked are lower when the site gets farther off from the first place rank.</p> <p>As Carolanne Mangles in <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Insight<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, stated:</p> <p>Click-through rates do, in fact, decline the further down SERPs the result is positioned.

However, PWAs themselves don't win top results in SERPs. To be sure that these JS-based entities are indeed discoverable by users, they need to meet some requirements.</p> <p>However, due to their JS-reliant nature, they can cause some SEO challenges. It is, undoubtedly, bad news. The good news is, however, the challenges concern Single Page Apps in general, and so SEO optimization of PWAs is possible when it follows the basic SEO practices.</p> <h3 id="basic-seo-principles"><a href="#basic-seo-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Basic SEO principles</h3> <ul><li>Make every page available through a unique URL that lacks fragment identifiers (e.g., #).</li> <li>Specify its canonical URL by using the canonical tag to let search engines know that this URL is the original source of content.</li> <li>In PWAMP configurations, use the rel=&quot; amphtml&quot; tag to specify the AMP URLs.</li> <li>Avoid cloaking (displaying different content for users and bots).</li> <li>Protect the integrity of the website by using HTTPS.</li> <li>Manage redirection correctly in case of any changes to the website.</li> <li>Improve website performance.</li> <li>Implement metadata.</li></ul> <p>PWAs, in spite of their JS-nature, meet some of these restrictions by default. They are fast, engaging, extremely lightweight, and reliable. However, their SEO-friendliness must be double-checked manually and through SEO tools that crawl the site with and without JS rendering to identify possible gaps. Successful verification solely by Lighthouse might not be enough to take the first place in SERPs.
