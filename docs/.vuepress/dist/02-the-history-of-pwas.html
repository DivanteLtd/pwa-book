This technology gave us the chance to retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. Five years later, we get AJAX - a technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.</p> <p>All these new technologies were based on some shared principles including linkability, accessibility both by humans and engines, UI richness as an addition to a functional core, and freedom to implement and distribute without any additional payments or permissions.</p> <p>The idea of a PWA wasn't invented either by Google or by Apple, but it was Steve Jobs who first presented the concept in front of the world, during the iPhone introduction in 2007. At the time, it seemed natural that external apps would help to increase the popularity of that device, and Jobs wanted developers to build apps using standard web technologies.</p> <p><img src="/pwabook/chapter/assets/Chapter_2.png" alt="Steve Jobs portrait"></p> <blockquote><p>“(...) you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services. And guess what?<br>
There’s no SDK that you need! You’ve got everything you need if you know how to write apps using the most modern web standards to write amazing apps for the iPhone today.<br>
So developers, we think we’ve got a very sweet story for you.

Native apps dominated the mobile network and helped to build Google and Apple’s power on mobile. Meanwhile, web owners, who were reluctant to plant data in their &quot;walled gardens”, began to switch to Responsive Web Design. With this approach, web pages display correctly on a variety of devices and screen sizes by using proportion-based grids, and media queries in CSS. The PWA-specific approach had to wait for its moment.</p> <p>As Alex Russell, Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google, pointed out in his text “<a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progressive Web Apps: Escaping Tabs Without Losing Our Soul<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>”, published on Infrequently.org in July 2015:</p> <blockquote><p>&quot;It happens on the web from time to time that powerful technologies come to exist without the benefit of marketing departments or slick packaging.

Microsoft's decision seems especially worth noting, considering the Giant from Redmond was able to take a step back and sacrifice its idea of a Universal Windows Platform to make room for PWAs - the concept introduced by Google.</p> <hr> <p>💡</p> <p><strong>Universal Windows Platform (UWP)</strong> is an API created by Microsoft and first introduced in Windows 10. The purpose of this platform is to help develop universal apps that run on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One and HoloLens without the need to be re-written for each.</p> <p>source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wikipedia</em><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <hr> <p>Of course, the introduction of UWP didn't succeed, which makes the choice to push PWA technology more pragmatic, but the collaboration between these kinds of forces still looks unusual. And yet, they managed to forge a partnership in developing PWA standards. Jeff Burtoft, Principal Program Manager at Microsoft, put it best when he said:</p> <p>Google led the way with Progressive Web Apps, and after a long process, we decided that we needed to fully support it.</p> <p><img src="/pwabook/chapter/assets/Chapter_2.3.png" alt="Jeff Burtoft portrait"></p> <p>At first, PWAs started to work on Chrome OS, Android, and Windows. Now, developers can also publish them on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/microsoft-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, which may seem to be harking back to the old “native app” approach a bit.</p> <p>What about Apple? It didn't rush.
