Now, nearly half of app time occurs in an individual’s top app, and 90% in the top five. The high level of app abandonment and the massive amount of apps popping up every day make it clear that breaking through the clutter is very difficult, to say nothing of engaging users and convincing them to purchase.</p> <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) aren't the answer to all these challenges. However, they seem to be the answer to at least some of the issues connected with gaining mobile users' attention, improving the quality of their experiences and - at last - narrowing the mobile gap.</p> <p>All the available data shows mobile conversion rates much lower compared to desktop.</p> <p><img src="/pwabook/chapter/assets/Chapter_5.1.png" alt="Mobile gap - 49%"></p> <p>Of course, mobile users might not yet be in the decision stage. They are often looking for inspiration or doing some research, but some of them - even if they are ready to buy - never finish their purchase path. Why? There can be multiple reasons for abandoning the purchase path on mobile devices.

It raises the need to take care of consistent UX during users’ online journey. If it is not managed properly, users need to learn a new interface every time they change device or channel.

The safest and the most common idea for mobile product listing is a single column view. It is, however, not a universal solution. But with Progressive Web Apps, it is relatively easy to experiment with content customization.</p> <h3 id="by-re-engagement-strategies"><a href="#by-re-engagement-strategies" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> by re-engagement strategies</h3> <p>Push notifications can be a double-edged sword but - if done right - may be a great way to remind users about yourself. With PWA's consistent UX and secure environment (HTTPS), it may be easier to win users' trust and convince them to sign up for a subscription.</p> <h3 id="by-localizing-the-content"><a href="#by-localizing-the-content" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> by localizing the content</h3> <p>A PWA - thanks to the usage of data from GPS - allows to make content more local and so offer, e.g. discounts for some specific localizations or mix and change the sort order according to the users' location. Thanks to this, the app can become more personal.</p> <h3 id="by-adding-innovative-payment-methods"><a href="#by-adding-innovative-payment-methods" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> by adding innovative payment methods</h3> <p>One of the most significant issues in the mobile channel is payments. To persuade the user to finalize a transaction on mobile, they must be provided with methods that are simple, safe, and secure, and the whole process must be smooth and quick. Progressive Web Apps, with their implemented mobile-first approach, help businesses to match users’ expectations in that field.</p> <h3 id="by-being-responsive-to-users"><a href="#by-being-responsive-to-users" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> by being responsive to users</h3> <p>A JavaScript Web App enables animation of every interaction and informs the user about what is happening at any given moment.

A PWA's capacity for offline support is most crucial for mobile users. They use their smartphones on the run; the quality of the internet connection may vary depending on the circumstances, and mobile data, especially during travel time, need to be used wisely.</p> <p>With PWA offline mode, it is possible to continue browsing or shopping without any interruption.
