Their Digital Marketing Department was aware of the need to upgrade their approach to mobile when smartphone traffic surpassed desktop traffic in early 2016 and showed no signs of slowing down. Their first idea of how to embrace the new reality was, naturally, a mobile app, but Malik Abu-Ghazaleh, Global Head of Digital at Lancôme, was skeptical. He thought that despite the benefits of mobile apps, which deliver an excellent user experience and personalized content, they have severe disadvantages: they are expensive to build, and shoppers need a strong hook to download them.</p> <p>Progressive Web Apps promised all of the pros of mobile apps, without their cons, but it was a very fresh concept, and so the implementation seemed risky.</p> <p><img src="/pwabook/chapter/assets/Chapter_7_Lancome_PWA.png" alt="Lancome PWA"></p> <p>Abu-Ghazaleh decided to take his chances. In the summer of 2016, Lancôme launched their new PWA-based site and it quickly became apparent that it was a hit. It turned out to be more effective than a regular mobile website and cheaper than a mobile app.</p> <p>The new site is about 50% faster than the previous one, and Lancôme's mobile sales have increased by 16% year over year.</p> <blockquote><p>💡 <strong>On average across all of its mobile pages in February, the site loaded in 3.5 seconds, which is much faster than the 8-9 second average in February 2016.</strong> Plus, a faster site gives Lancome-usa.com a huge SEO boost from Google, <a href="http://www.fastmoving.co.za/news/retailer-news-16/lancome-speeds-its-mobile-site-with-google-s-progressive-web-apps-9959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> Abu-Ghazaleh. Of the 26 brands L'Oréal Paris owns, Lancôme has the fastest site.</p></blockquote> <p>Lancôme wasn't the only one who decided to speed up its mobile site with Progressive Web Apps. Housing.com, one of India's top startups operating in the online real estate space, was able to increase conversions by about 38%, speed up page load by 30%, decrease bounce rate by 40% and extend the average session by 10%, thanks to PWA technology.</p> <h3 id="housing-com"><a href="#housing-com" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Housing.com</h3> <p>For this Indian company, seamless performance on mobile was crucial since Indian users are more likely to own a mobile phone and use it to access the internet than own a laptop and use a wired internet connection. Housing.com, aware of that, developed a native app, but it wasn't an optimal solution. The cost of internet access in India remains relatively high, and consumers are cautious about using mobile data to download native apps, even though they demand an ultra-fast UX. Housing.com did its research and discovered that even a one-second improvement of page load time brought a significant boost in the conversion rate.</p> <p>With a PWA, the page-load performance of the Housing.com site increased by over 30%, and the average time-per-session increased 10% across all browsers.</p> <blockquote><p>Understanding the network limitations of our users and the importance of a great user experience led us to build a PWA, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> Vivek Jain, Housing.com CPTO.

They also need to provide users with fast loading features while consuming less data, so PWA technology, with its mobile-friendly nature, seems to be the best answer to challenges implied by a growing mobile audience. Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram already agreed to that.</p> <h3 id="twitter"><a href="#twitter" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Twitter</h3> <p>Thanks to their PWA, which became the default mobile web experience for all users globally in April 2017, Twitter was able to re-engage mobile users more effectively, provide them with a smooth but creamy UX, while consuming less data. After implementing the &quot;Add to Homescreen&quot; prompt asking users to save Twitter Lite to their homescreens, Twitter has seen 250,000 unique daily users launch Twitter Lite from the homescreen – four times a day on average.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Twitter Lite is now the fastest, least expensive, and most reliable way to use Twitter.</strong> The web app rivals the performance of our native apps but requires less than 3% of the device storage space compared to Twitter for Android, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2017/twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> Nicolas Gallagher, the Engineering Lead for Twitter Lite.</p></blockquote> <p>PWA-based Twitter consumes less data by default, relying on cached data and optimized images as much as possible. It allows reducing data consumption by as much as 70% as users scroll through their timelines. The PWA is only 600KB over the wire vs. 23.5MB of downloaded data needed to install the native Android app.</p> <p><img src="/pwabook/chapter/assets/Chapter_7_Twitter_PWA.png" alt="Twitter PWA"></p> <h3 id="pinterest"><a href="#pinterest" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pinterest</h3> <p>Similar reasons are behind the PWA implementation by Pinterest. This platform was struggling with engaging mobile users who suffered from a poor UX. Because of the slow web experience for people in low-bandwidth environments and limited data plans, Pinterest managed to convert only a fraction of them into signups, logins, or native app installs.</p> <p>It was a huge drawback but also an opportunity, so the decision was a no-brainer. The shift to a PWA that supports an app shell, add to homescreen, push notifications and asset caching, took only 3 months and led to several technological improvements. Time spent on the site is up by 40% compared to the old mobile web experience, user-generated ad revenue is up 44%, and core engagements are up 60%.</p> <p>The core business metrics also proved that investing in a full-featured PWA has met expectations.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Weekly active users on the mobile web have increased 103% year-over-year overall, with a 156% increase in Brazil and a 312% increase in India.</strong> On the engagement side, session length increased by 296%, the number of Pins seen increased by 401% and people were 295% more likely to save a Pin to a board. Those are amazing in and of themselves, but the growth front is where things really shone. Logins increased by 370% , and new signups increased by 843% year-over-year. Since we shipped the new experience, mobile web has become the top platform for new signups.

Why? The leading cause of why mobile devices generate the majority of internet traffic but the minority of eCommerce conversions is a poor mobile user experience. The desktop-oriented content displayed on mobile devices causes frustration, so customers abandon their mobile shopping journey. In the best possible scenario, they switch to a different device and channel, but when a company has most of its traffic generated by mobile, there may be some missed opportunities to finalize sales.</p> <h3 id="dw-shop"><a href="#dw-shop" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> DW Shop</h3> <p>DW Shop, a sub-brand of DW Creative Group, created by Polish hair stylist Dariusz Wójcik, faced precisely this challenge.
